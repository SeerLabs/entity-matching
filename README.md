Match entities between CiteSeerX and other digital libraries
In this project, we attempt to develop a machine learning (ML) based method to match paper entities between CiteSeerX and other digital libraries, including but not limited to the IEEE Xplore (IEEE hereafter), DBLP, Web of Science (WoS hereafter). Like most ML-based methods, data preprocessing takes substantial efforts. The purpose of creating this codebase is to centralize working programs that accomplish different tasks so they can be reused for future people that take over corresponding roles.
